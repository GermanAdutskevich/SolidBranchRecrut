This is my first project in Angular. Here also were used Bootsrap and JSON Server.

To open a project, use two commands `npm run server` and then `npm start`.

Using the database, a welcome message and information about the number of all transactions is displayed at the top of the page. There is also a button 'see transactions' that allows you to view all transactions.

Below there are four transaction types, where the amount of the given type of transaction is displayed and the 'see all' button allows you to view detailed information about the transaction.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.
